# INDRA-Sat-Diff: A Deep Learning Framework for Climate Forecasting

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

**INDRA-Sat-Diff** is a comprehensive, PyTorch Lightning-based framework for training and evaluating deep learning models for high-resolution climate and weather forecasting. It implements a sophisticated three-stage training pipeline centered around a latent diffusion model, guided by a physics-informed alignment model to produce physically plausible and accurate predictions.

The architectural design and training methodology of this framework are heavily inspired by the principles and implementation of **PreDiff** ("Precipitation Nowcasting with Latent Diffusion Models," Gao et al., NeurIPS 2023). Our goal is to provide a refactored, accessible, and user-friendly implementation of these powerful techniques, complete with a streamlined workflow for custom datasets.

This framework is designed to be highly configurable and extensible, allowing researchers and practitioners to easily adapt it to different datasets and forecasting challenges.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Modular Three-Stage Training Pipeline:** Ensures robust and stable training by decoupling the learning of data representation, physical constraints, and the forecasting process itself.
*   **Powerful Command-Line Interface:** Simple and intuitive commands (`preprocess`, `train`, `forecast`) for managing the end-to-end workflow.
*   **Highly Configurable:** A clean and powerful configuration system allows users to define their entire experiment‚Äîfrom data paths and model architecture to training parameters‚Äîin a single YAML file.
*   **Built-in Visualization:** Automatically generates static plots and animated GIFs of forecast outputs for easy analysis and presentation.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** Designed from the ground up to allow for the integration of new model architectures, datasets, and physical constraints.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The framework's core is a **Latent Diffusion Model** that learns to reverse a noise-adding process in a compressed latent space. The training is performed in three distinct stages to ensure stability and performance:

1.  **Stage 1: Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Training**
    *   A VAE is trained to compress high-resolution climate data into a lower-dimensional, information-rich latent space. This allows the subsequent diffusion model to operate much more efficiently.

2.  **Stage 2: Knowledge Alignment Model Training**
    *   A separate model is trained to predict a specific physical property (e.g., the average precipitation intensity over the forecast period) directly from a *noisy* latent state and a corresponding timestep. This model learns a representation of the physical constraint.

3.  **Stage 3: Latent Diffusion Model Training**
    *   The main forecasting model, a U-Net based on the Cuboid Transformer, is trained to denoise a random latent state, conditioned on the previous weather states. During sampling (forecasting), the gradient from the pre-trained **Alignment Model** is used to guide the diffusion process, steering the forecast towards physically consistent and realistic outcomes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up your environment, installing the framework, and running the provided example.

### Prerequisites

*   Git
*   Python 3.9+
*   **uv**: We highly recommend using `uv` for fast and reliable environment management. You can install it via: `pip install uv`.

### Installation Steps

All commands should be run from your terminal.

**1. Clone the Repository**
First, clone this repository to a location on your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/indra-sat-diff.git
cd indra-sat-diff
```

**2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
It is standard practice to work within a virtual environment.

```bash
# This creates a .venv folder in the repository's root directory
uv venv

# Activate the environment (command depends on your shell)
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install the Framework and Dependencies**
Install the `climate-forecast` package in "editable" mode (`-e`). This is the recommended approach, as it allows you to modify the source code and have the changes immediately take effect without reinstalling.

```bash
# This command reads the pyproject.toml and installs everything
uv pip install -e .
```
You are now ready to use the framework!

## ‚ö° Quick Start: Running the Example

The best way to get started is to run the self-contained project in the `examples/` directory. This directory is a template for how you should structure your own independent projects.

**1. Navigate to the Example Directory**
```bash
cd examples
```

**2. Follow the Tutorial**
Inside the `examples/` directory, you will find a detailed `README.md` file. This is your primary guide. It will walk you through:
*   Setting up the necessary data folders.
*   Configuring the `config.yaml` for your dataset.
*   Running the `preprocess`, `train`, and `forecast` commands.

**Follow the instructions in `examples/README.md` to run your first complete experiment.**
